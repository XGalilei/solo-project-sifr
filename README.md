# SIFR
## Description
SIFR is intended to be an exploration of classical cryptography and codes (although not all of said codes, such as Morse Code, are intended to be secretive).
For every cipher and code currently supported, SIFR provides an overview of the process, a history of usage, and the ability for a user to encrypt or decrypt
custom messages. For specific ciphers/codes, there is the option to users to create their own challenges, as well as attempt challenges from others.

Currently, SIFR encryption/decryption supports single-case A-Z (no diacritics like "ñ" or "ü") character encryption. 

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

## Acknowledgement
SIFR would not be possible without the help of Prime Digital Academy, who provided the base framework for the project as well as the knowledge necessary to
get the project working. I would also like to thank the members of the Proth Cohort and the network we've formed.

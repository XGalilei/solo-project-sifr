        <p>While classical cryptography and codes have largely been supplanted by more modern inventions, they still have a place in our minds and imaginations. 
          SIFR is a place to learn more about these ciphers and codes, as well as test your understanding by making and/or attempting challenges in them.</p>
        <p>SIFR is still very much a work in progress, and there is plenty more to be added. The three encodings currently supported are intended to serve as an example for 
          the content that is to come. Feedback is greatly appreciated, so feel free to leave some.</p>
